# BancontactSecurityDisabler (WIP)
Xposed module to bypass the security on the Bancontact app (in Belgium)

Note: might not compile on Windows (due to aUX being a reserved filename),
but it is possible to use this module without that class, as it's currently unused (it is needed to bypass USB Debugging, but I was unsuccesful thus far)
